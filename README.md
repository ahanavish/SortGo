# SortGo
Sorting algorithms is one of the most important and widespread operations in computer science. They are used to sort a data structure according to a specific order relationship, such as numerical order or lexicographical order. For a long time, new methods have been developed to make this procedure faster and faster. There are currently hundreds of sorting algorithms, each with its specific characteristics, classified according to two metrics: space complexity andtime complexity.
</br></br> Sorting algorithms can be difficult to understand and it’s very easy to get confused.

<strong>SortGo</strong> is a sorting visualizer, which allows the user to select the algorithms they would like to visualize and get a deeper understanding of how a specific algorithm works.

It allows the users to select one of the 6 Sorting algorithms: </br>
-> Bubble </br> 
-> Heap </br> 
-> Insertion </br> 
-> Quick </br> 
-> Selection </br> 
-> Shell </br>

Future Scope:  </br>
• Other visualizations – Add more sorting algorithms and data structures like Linked List, Queues, Stacks, Trees, and Graphs. </br>
• Gamification – Create a profile, have an avatar, add elements of game mechanics, reward users with points/ badges. </br>
• Community – Connect and collaborate with other developers. </br>
• Asking queries – Get their doubts solved and help other programmers </br>
